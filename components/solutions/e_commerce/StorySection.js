          SparkAI was crafted in close collaboration with e-commerce businesses that wanted to
          increase conversions, reduce cart abandonment, and provide instant customer support. From
          product questions to order tracking, every part of the solution
          was developed by listening to real customer needs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          With every new online store we work with, we improve SparkAI further â€” shaping
          it based on real shopping conversations, customer feedback, and sales results. It's not just
          a chatbot. It's a continuously evolving sales assistant, tailored to convert.
