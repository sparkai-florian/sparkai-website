          Spark AI began with a simple observation: businesses lose time and revenue when responses are slow or inconsistent.
          We build approachable AI that answers instantly, books appointments, and guides customers to the right action.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Our mission is to simplify processes, cut costs, and raise confidence in AI technology. We design clear conversation
          flows, integrate with your tools, and measure impact so teams can focus on the work that matters.
